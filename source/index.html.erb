The world scouts at us whale hunters

At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart;
he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the
blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every
ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.
<br><br>

So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not
notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings
should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.
